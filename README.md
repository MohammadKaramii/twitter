This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Next.js App with Tailwind CSS and Authentication via NextAuth.js

This is a Next.js application styled with Tailwind CSS and integrated with authentication using NextAuth.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Create a .env.local file at the root of your project with the following keys:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_nextauth_url
```
Replace your_firebase_api_key, your_google_client_id, your_google_client_secret, your_nextauth_secret, and your_nextauth_url with your actual keys and URLs.

Start the development server:
```bash

npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.
Notes
Make sure to keep these keys secure and do not expose them publicly in your code repository or elsewhere.

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, so you can customize the styles easily.
